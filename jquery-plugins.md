# jQuery Plugins

Let's use our knowledge of jQuery to make some plugins - or
modular bits of code that we can re-use to spiff up our websites!

## Tabs
Make three files: 
* tabs.html
* tabs.js
* tabs.css

In tabs.html, include the following HTML boilerplate:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>

...and add a ul with the class 'tabs' inside the body. Between the head tags, include tags to require your js and css files, as well as jQuery.
